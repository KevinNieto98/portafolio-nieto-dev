Glodis is a company specialized in tracking and delivering international orders, managing shipments bound for Honduras.

In 2022, I contributed to various features on their back-office website, worked on the New Shipment module in their app, and implemented corrections to enhance the app's functionality.

During this time, I gained experience with technologies such as Firebase Firestore, Firebase Functions, React.js, and React Native.
